This package includes two code samples by Yutao He. One is written in Stata and the other one is written in R. Both code samples focus on financial econometrics.

Stata project corresponds a primal version of the Undergraduate Thesis: Hedging With Gold and Oil: Plausibility, Effectiveness and Evidence from Markets. (This is listed in my CV as part of the Solo-Authored papers.) This project uses multivariate GARCH model to estimate the dynamic conditional correlation between the return of gold, oil and market index. The aim of this project is to use the dynamic conditional correlation to estimate how well gold can be immune from the changes in stock market.

The folder names 'Regression Main' includes the main empirical analysis of the project and all figures and tables generated by Stata are included in that folder. The .do file is executable, and the corresponding figures and tables will be generated and saved in the folder.

R projects corresponds the project: Do Bulls and Bears Move Across Borders: A Revisit. This project is a replication of Engel and Lin's Review of Financial Studies paper in 1994 using the data between 2010 and 2021, which estimated how the market shocks transmitted between United States and Japan. (The good thing is that there is no overlap between the two markets.)

The file Code.R is the main regression file, including data cleaning, merging and regression analysis. The MLE.R file is an auxiliary function for most-likelihood estimation proposed by Engel and Lin. The original paper is included in the paper folder and the manuscript of my version of paper is available upon request. The sample results are presented in Figures folder and they are comparable with the original paper's result.

One problem to this coding sample is that this coding sample cannot direct run: the data: US and Japan are over 150 megabytes, making them inconvenient to be uploaded.

The Code_Thesis_Yutao_He folder contains the code for my MA thesis (also my writing sample).

Hope this readme file can help you better navigate through this replication package.
